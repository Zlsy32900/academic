👩‍🎓 I am currently having my master degree in King's College London

🔬My research interest is in Robotics control, Reinforcement Learning, Construction Robotics

📘My recent thesis is Real-Time Balancing of a Quadrupedal Robot through Optimization of Cartesian Centre-of-Mass Impedances using Reinforcement Learning, if you get interested in it, feel free to click 'Portfolio' at the top menu 👆

💁🏻‍♀️ Let me introduce myself : 
If you wanna see more details, please click 'CV' at the top menu

I finished my bachelor degree in Heilongjiang University, Harbin, China. I studied civil engineering - Hydraulic Engineering.
I graduated sixth in my major with 90. My bachelor degree bring me a great foundation in mathmatics and physics, and structural mind when experiencing problems.

I having my master degree in King's College London, and I started to get in touch with lot of robotics courses, like Robotics System, Real-time System, Machine Learning, Sensor and Actuator. I achieved distinction grades in these courses, and felt like they take me to a new world - robotics. In this field, I could ultilize lot of advanced technology to address the existing problem, enabling robots perform better and do what humans could not done. Quite Challenging and I love Chanllenging!

Therefore, I chose robot control optimization via reinforcement learning as my final thesis. I learned a lot of RL and robotics dynamic, control knowledge.
